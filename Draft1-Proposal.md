PROJECT TITLE: Transportation Analyzer

Problem Statement:
Transportation data not being properly utilized, distributed or analyzed and traffic congestion.
These are problems being faced in the
Philippines in regards to transportation. Why should we even worry about such problems?
These problems
can lead to even more issues in the future, 
let's take traffic congestion for example. If all cars are stuck in one place they would be forced to stay on for a longer period therefore releasing more dangerous funes from the exhaust of diesel-power ed vehicles, this leads to air pollution and even more complicated issues in the future.

In conclusion, these problems on transportation may start out small but with time it can become a much bigger threat.

Project Objectives:
1. To develop a program that processes and sorts trip information based on user-defined criteria such as destination, occupancy rate, date of trip, status, and fare.
2. To generate analytical outputs by calculating and displaying the number of trips that meet specific conditions, along with their average occupancy rates and fares.

Planned Features:
The code will ask the user for a criteria to sort the trips with (destination, travel duration, bus operator).
The code will ask for a secondary criteria if any.
The code will display the number of trips that fill the criteria.
The code will display the average occupancy rate of the trips that fill the criteria.
The code will display the average fare of the trips that fill the criteria.

Planned inputs:

"How would the user like to sort the information in the following criteria ( ID trip, date of departure, destination, fare, occupancy rate, and status):"
"Enter second criteria if there's not enter "N/A":”

Planned outputs: 

“The average occupancy rate is”, {rate}.

“The average fare is”, {fare}.

“The number of trips that fill out the criteria”, {no.trip}.

Planned Logic:
Load JSON file
Display options for criteria
Input first criteria
Input second criteria 
Take and display the average occupancy rate based on the range of the criteria/s
Take and display the average fare based on the range of the criteria/s
Take and display the number of trips that are within the range of the criteria/s
