PROJECT TITLE: Transportation Analyzer

Problem Statement:
Transportsti on data not being properly utilized, distributed or analyzed and traffic congestion.
These are problems being faced in the
Philippines in regards to transportati on. Why should we even worry about such problems?
Well this problems
can lead to even more issues in the future, let's take traffic
You sent
let's take traffic congestion for example. If all cars are stuck in one place they would be forced to stay on for a longer period therefore releasing more dangerous funes from the exhaust of diesel-power ed vehicles, this leads to air
pollution and even more complicated issues in the future.

vehicles, this leads to air
pollution and even more complicated issues in the future.
In conclusion, these problems on transportati on may start out small but with time it can become a much bigger threat.

Project Objectives:
1. To develop a program that processes and sorts trip information based on user-defined criteria such as destination, occupancy rate, date of trip, status, and fare.
2. To generate analytical outputs by calculating and displaying the number of trips that meet specific conditions, along with their average occupancy rates and fares.

Planned Features:
The code will ask the user for a criteria to sort the trips with (destination, travel duration, bus operator).
The code will ask for a secondary criteria if any.
The code will display the number of trips that fill the criteria.
The code will display the average occupancy rate of the trips that fill the criteria.
The code will display the average fare of the trips that fill the criteria.

Planned inputs:
"Enter ID trip:"
"How would you like to sort the information following these criterias (destination, occupancy rate, date of trip and status, fare):"
"Enter the date of the trip using the following format (Month, day, year):"
"Enter the destination:"
"Enter status:"
Planned outputs:
[ ] "The number of people who arrived at their destination on time:",
[ ] "The number of people whose arrival was delayed:",
[ ] "The number of people who cancelled their departure:",
[ ] "Number of people who departed on 9/20/2025:"
[ ] "Number of people who departed on 9/21/2025:",
[ ] "Number of people who departed on 9/22/2025:",
[ ] "The number of people who went to Tagum:",
[ ] "The number of people who went to Compostela:",
[ ] "The number of people who went to Mati:",
[ ] "The number of people whose ID trip's third digit starts with no.1:",
[ ] "The number of people whose ID trip's third digit starts with no.2:",
[ ] "The number of people whose ID trip's third digit starts with no.3:",
[ ] "This individual is a went to", {destination}, "on", {date}, "and they arrived on time. Their ID trip is:", {ID}
[ ] "This individual went to", {destination}, "on", {date}, "and they got delayed. And their ID trip is:", {ID}
[ ] "This individual went to", {destination}, "on", {date}, "and they cancelled their trip. And their ID trip is:", {ID}
